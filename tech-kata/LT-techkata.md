### 🐛 TICKET-002: Investment Calculator Throws TypeError

**Type:** Bug  
**Priority:** Critical  
**Estimated Time:** 10 minutes

**Description:**

The investment calculator feature is currently broken and throws a `TypeError: 'NoneType' object is not subscriptable` when users navigate to the Investment Calculator page. This is a critical bug as it prevents the page from loading entirely.

**Error Details:**

```
TypeError at /free-tools/investment-calculator/
'NoneType' object is not subscriptable

Request Method: GET
Request URL: http://localhost:8000/free-tools/investment-calculator/
Django Version: 5.2.6
Exception Type: TypeError
Exception Value: 'NoneType' object is not subscriptable
Exception Location: /workspaces/stingrays-finance-app/apps/core/views.py, line 54, in investment_calculator
Raised during: apps.core.views.investment_calculator
Python Version: 3.11.13
```

**Steps to Reproduce:**

1. Start the Django development server
2. Navigate to `/free-tools/investment-calculator/`
3. Observe the TypeError being thrown immediately upon page load
4. The page fails to render

**Root Cause:**

The error occurs at line 54 in `apps/core/views.py` where the code attempts to access `results['final_value']`, but `results` is `None`. This suggests the calculation function is returning `None` instead of a dictionary with the expected keys.

**Expected Behavior:**

- The Investment Calculator page should load successfully without errors
- Users should be able to view the calculator form
- When form is submitted with valid inputs, calculations should be performed
- Results should be displayed in a user-friendly format

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- [ ] Investment Calculator page loads without throwing TypeError
- [ ] Page displays the input form correctly on GET requests
- [ ] Users can input initial investment amount, interest rate, and time period
- [ ] Backend calculates compound interest accurately using formula: P(1 + r/n)^(nt)
- [ ] Results are displayed in a user-friendly format after form submission
- [ ] Form validation prevents invalid inputs (negative values, empty fields, etc.)
- [ ] Error handling for edge cases is implemented
- [ ] No errors are thrown during normal operation

**Technical Specifications:**

- Fix the bug in `apps/core/views.py` at line 54
- Ensure the view handles both GET and POST requests properly
- The calculation function should return a dictionary with expected keys or handle None case
- Implement proper form handling and validation
- Add error handling for edge cases
- Follow Django best practices for URL routing
- Consider adding unit tests for calculation logic

**Investigation Notes:**

- Primary issue: Line 54 in `apps/core/views.py` - `results['final_value']` where `results` is `None`
- Check if calculation function is being called conditionally (only on POST)
- Verify the view logic distinguishes between GET (display form) and POST (process form) requests
- Ensure template rendering has appropriate context for both scenarios
